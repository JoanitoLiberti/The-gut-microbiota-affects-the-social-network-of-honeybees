## The current folder contains all the R scripts used in the analyses of automated behavioral tracking data

Scripts are presented as separate r markdown files. The ResDF.csv data table is used as input for plots and statistical analyses. Set paths within .md files to match the location of the downloaded files on your local drive.
Additional input files required to reproduce the analyses should be downloaded from Zenodo at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5797980

# The gut microbiota affects the social network of honeybees

We used a combination of automated behavioural tracking, metabolomics and RNA-sequencing to investigate the effect of the gut microbiota on the social behaviour of honeybees and to decipher the underlying molecular mechanisms along the gut - brain axis. We found that the gut microbiota promotes and structures social interactions in the social network of honeybees. These effects on social behavior are correlated with increased abundance of metabolites in the brain and with gene expression changes related to amino acid metabolism and epigenetic modifications in an area of the brain implicated in perception of sensory stimuli. <br />

In the present repository we provide all data, metadata and codes needed to reproduce the analyses. Additional input data required for automated behavioral tracking analyses should be downloaded from Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5797980

Separate folders contain data, metadata and codes for each component of the study: automated behavioral tracking, RNA-sequencing, metabolomics and analyses of gut microbiota composition and abundance by amplicon-sequencing and qPCR.
